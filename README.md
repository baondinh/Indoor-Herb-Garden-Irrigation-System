# Indoor-Herb-Garden-Irrigation-System
A microcontroller-based automated irrigation system designed for indoor herb gardens. This project ensures optimal watering for your plants by monitoring soil moisture levels and controlling water delivery using sensors and pumps. Ideal for small-scale indoor gardening enthusiasts, the system combines efficiency, sustainability, and convenience.

### Key Features: 
- Microcontroller Integration: Built with Arduino, ESP32, or similar devices.
- Moisture Sensors: Monitors soil moisture to determine when watering is needed.
- Water Pump Control: Automates precise watering to prevent over- or under-watering.
- Customizable Settings: Allows users to adjust thresholds and schedules based on plant needs.
- Power Efficiency: Designed to minimize energy and water usage.
- User Interface (Optional): Integrates with a mobile app or web interface for monitoring and control.

### Future Goals: 
- Apartment herb garden
- Camper van conversion garden
- Controlled growing environment for succulents?
- Complete this project during LEAP life and have a working prototype
